  "forest_tree.treedesignergui.descriptions.secondaryPitchHorizontal":"The weights are used differently based on the pitch of the current branch, so the names might not match how they are actually used, but generally giving a higher weight to the 45 degree will make it grow upwards. Expect similar results with other values as well.",

For example, when the tree's age is 11 and this value is 5, terminal meristems that are older than 6 will die. The death rate of younger meristems depends on a uniform probability distribution.",
